        <p id = "a1">
            An alphabet is a standardized set of basic written symbols or graphemes (called letters) that represent the phonemes of certain spoken languages. Not all writing systems represent language in this way; in a syllabary, each character represents a syllable, for instance, and logographic systems use characters to represent words, morphemes, or other semantic units
            <br>
            Alphabets can be of different types:
            <ul id = "a1">
                <li>Arabic</li>
                <li>Brahmic</li>
                <li>Cyrillic</li>
                <li>English</li>
                <li>Greek</li>
                <li>Hebrew</li>
                <li>Latin</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p id = "a1">
